\section*{Notes on frequentist topology testing (Woods Hole Workshop on Molecular Evolution, 2011)}
Thanks to Joe Felsenstein for the use of images in the slides.

\begin{quote}
	We have two  trees that differ in their score. 
	Let's say that tree 2's log-likelihood is 1.59 higher than the log-likelihood of tree 1 (the likelihoods have to be calculated on the same data set).
	
	{\bf Is a difference in log-likelihoods too large to be explained by sampling error?}
	
\end{quote}

We will denote the log-likelihood on tree 1 as $\lnL(T_1|X)$ where $X$ represents the data.

We will denote 2 times the difference in $\lnL$ as a delta test statistic: $$\delta(T_1,T_2|X) = 2\left[\ln L(T_1|X) - \ln L(T_2|X)\right]$$

\subsection{Notation}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item $X$ will denote the data. $x_i$ denotes column $i$ in the matrix.\\
	\item $T_i$ denotes tree i. $\hat{T}$ is the MLE of the tree. \\
	\item $^{(j)}$ superscripts in parentheses denote bootstrap replicates. $X^{(j)}$ would be the $j$-th bootstrap replicate dataset; $\hat{T}^{(j)}$ would be the MLE of the tree for that dataset.\\
	\item $\expect{Y}$ denotes the expected value of some statistic, $Y$.  You can think of the expected value as the mean that you would calculate if you could perform an infinitely large number of simulations.
	\item $\bar y$ denotes the mean value of some observed statistic, $y$.
\end{compactitem}
\subsection{Null hypotheses and the null distribution}
If the null hypothesis was true, what is the probability that we would see a difference in log-likelihood that is at least as large as the observed value?
This probability is the \pvalue.
If we have a low \pvalue we can feel comfortable rejecting the null hypothesis.
A low \pvalue implies that we will falsely reject the null hypothesis rarely.
We can calculate the \pvalue by figuring out the null distribution - the probability distribution that shows how frequent different values of the $\delta$ test statistic would be even if the null hypothesis were true.


\subsection{The plethora of topology tests}
There are a large number of topology tests because there are a number of ways of calculating the null distribution
Specifically:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item We can estimate the \pvalue from bootstrapping and associated corrections (see sections on BP, aBP, AU, EHH), or
	\item We can estimate the \pvalue by looking at the $\delta$ test statistic. If we do this:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item there are several different ways to formulate the null hypothesis,
		\item there are several different ways to approximate the null distribution of $\delta$ because:
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item there are different ways to approximate the variance of $\delta$
			\item it is important to know whether or not the trees to be tested are specified {\em a priori} or estimated from the dataset at hand.
		\end{compactitem}
	\end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}

\section*{Visualizing pattern frequency space}
We can rigorously describe phylogenetic inference by placing it in a geometrical framework in which we have a multidimensional space in which the coordinate in each dimension represents the proportion of sites that have (or would we be expected to have) a particular data pattern.  
\citet{Kim2000} presents a very nice description of this view of tree space.
Unfortunately the rigorous view of pattern frequency space involves a huge number of dimensions.  
For nucleotides there are $4^N$ possible patterns for $N$ sequences!

I like to draw graphs for tree inference for 4 sequences (A, B, C, and D).
In these graphs, I squash the rigorous pattern frequency world down to a simplified space.
I display the relative proportion of each parsimony-informative pattern among the class of parsimony-informative patterns.
{\bf Warning: This squashing down to relative frequencies for 3 patterns makes the graphs rough tools, and not perfect depictions of the phylogeny inference problem}\footnote{In fact if we {\em only had information about the relative frequency of parsimony-informative pattern}, we cannot accurately estimate a four-species tree because every possible tree can generate every possible spectrum of pattern frequencies\citep{AllmanHR2010}}. 
The strong connections between the pattern frequency space and tree inference apply to the full space of the frequencies over all patterns, but not to the easy-to-draw pictures.

Even in this simple case, there are too many patterns to visualize so I make two further simplifications:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item consider a two-state (0 and 1) version of the simplest model (it is often called the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model, and it is like a two-state version of Jukes-Cantor)
	\item define the state that shows up in species A to be state 1
\end{compactitem}
This means that the parsimony-informative patterns (denoted in the order ABCD) are: 1100 (which prefers the tree that groups A and B), 1010 (which prefers the tree that groups A and C), and 1001 (which prefers the tree that groups A and D).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

   \vspace{-0pt}
   \vspace{-40pt}
  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
I plot the relative frequencies of these patterns in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system_(mathematics)}{Barycentric coordinate space}, as shown on the right.
The frequency of a pattern can be read by looking at the distance between the point and the sides of the equilateral triangle.
Somewhat confusingly the pattern frequency is the distance from the side that is opposite the labelled point.
So the point shown by the black dot would represent approximately:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	P(1100) & \approx & 0.5\\
	P(1010) & \approx & 0.1\\
	P(1001) & \approx & 0.4
\end{eqnarray*}
(remember these are the relative frequencies of the patterns given that it is parsimony-informative pattern, so these have to sum to one).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

   \vspace{-40pt}

    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{../newimages/simple-treespace-trees2.pdf}
    \vspace{-120pt}
  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
We use this view of tree space because we can plot data points in this space, and we can also represent the prediction of different trees into the same space.
The figures to the right show how some trees project into this space.  
The idea is that if we were to use our simple model of 0$\leftrightarrow$1 evolution on those trees, then they would predict pattern frequencies that exactly match the point that the arrows point to.
In the lower panel, we see the points in the three trees (one for each topology) that are as close as possible\footnote{``As close as possible'' only applies if we constrain branch lengths in certain non-obvious ways. The topology tests and the real approaches to ML tree inference do {\bf not} make these constraints. I just impose them when making these figures to make the cartoons clearer.} to the sampled data (the black dot).
If we think of the distance as the Kullback-Leibler distance, then those distances can be thought of -1 times the $\lnL$ for any tree (smaller distance directly translates to higher $\lnL$ in the actual pattern frequency space\footnote{This connection is lost when we look at the relative pattern frequencies -- but we'll ignore that, since we are using these pictures as rough guides only. The KL-distance is better thought of as a log likelihood ratio between the ``multinomial likelihood'' \citep[{\em aka} th ``unconstrained likelihood''][]{Goldman1993} that represents the highest possible likelihood for any {\em i.i.d.} model and the likelihood under a tree model.}.
Note that the closest point for the A+C {\em vs} B+D tree is actually the star tree.
Under a star tree with all of the terminal branch lengths constrained to have same length, all three parsimony-informative data patterns will be equally frequent; thus we get a point in the center of the triangle (distance = 1/3 from each side).

\section*{Dataset background}
I took 3000 sites from an alignment of 5 primates.

$T_1$ = (((chimp, gorilla), human),orang,gibbon), and $\ln L(T_1|X) = -7363.296$\par
$T_2$ = (((chimp, human), gorilla),orang,gibbon), and $\ln L(T_2|X) = -7361.707$\par

Below is a depiction of the $\delta$ test statistic and the expected value of the test statistic if we believe that the trees are equally good.\par
\begin{picture}(0,50)(0,-50)
	  \put(110,0){\small$\delta(T_1,T_2|X)=-3.18$}
	  \put(270,0){\small$\mathbb{E}(\delta) = 0$}

	  \put(250,-60){$\delta(T_1,T_2|X) $}
\end{picture}

To get a sense of the variablity in the signal, we can look like the $\delta$ statistic calculated on each site:\\
\begin{picture}(500,280)(0,-280)
	  \put(40,-120){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../scripts/mtdna/d1-2hist.pdf}}}
	  \put(170,-260){\normalsize$\delta(T_1,T_2|x_i)$}
	  \put(40,-120){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../scripts/mtdna/diff1-2hist.pdf}}}
\end{picture}
Note that the central bars of this histogram are cropped -- almost all of the sites do not discriminate between these trees so that $\delta(T_1,T_2|x_i)\approx0$ for these sites.
The per-site $\delta$ statistic for the 26 sites which have different parsimony scores on the two trees are shown in red.
Also note that the notation uses $x_i$ indicating that we are calculating the likelihood for a site (a subscript on $x$ will indicate a site index).  

\subsubsection{A side note on the Templeton test} In case you are curious, $\delta(T_1,T_2|x_i)\approx0$ instead of $\delta(T_1,T_2|x_i)=0$ even if a site $i$ represents a constant pattern.
You may wonder how a constant pattern prefers one tree over another tree.
The short answer is that a constant pattern by itself will not prefer one topology over another, but in the process of maximizing the likelihood jointly over all parameters the two trees will predict different probabilities of even the constant patterns.
Typically (if we ignore the numerical parameters of the model of sequence evolution), we will find that the smaller tree (the tree with the smaller sum of branch lengths) will predict more constant patterns.
This makes sense, because there is less opportunity for change on small trees.
Thus, even constant patterns will discriminate {\em very} slightly between trees.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test (that goes by the name of ``Templeton test'' in the realm of phylogenetics \citep{Templeton1983}) ignores the precise degree of preference for a tree, and simply ranks the sites by their preference between trees.
The test was proposed as a means of assessing statistical support when using parsimony, but has been applied to likelihood differences as well.
Because the subtle interactions between data and parameters lead to unexpected effects (such as constant patterns all favoring one tree, but very slightly), this sort of ranking of sites may not be a wise approach when using ML phylogenetic techniques.
The ``Paired-sites tests'' chapter (Chapter 21) of \citep{Felsenstein2004} discusses these issues more thoroughly.


\newpage
\section*{KH Test \citep{KishinoH1989} }
Two trees, $T_1$ and $T_2$, must be chosen {\bf before} looking at the data at hand.

\subsubsection{Test statistic} $\delta(T_1,T_2|X)$

\subsubsection{Null hypothesis} Two trees will explain the data equally well. 
In notation $\expect{\lnL(T_1|X)} = \expect{\lnL(T_1|X)}$ (where $\expectation$ denotes the expected value).  Thus:
$$\expect{\delta(T_1,T_2|X)} = 0$$

\subsubsection{Null distribution} We use the null hypothesis to let us set the expected value of the null distribution to 0.
To finish specifying the null distribution we can either
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Assume the the $\lnL$ values will follow a Normal distribution, and estimated the variance. Or
	\item Use bootstrapping to generate the a distribution, and then ``center'' this distribution so that it fits our null assumption that the mean of the distribution will be 0.
\end{compactenum}

\subsubsection{Details of the bootstrapping approach}
A distribution of $\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)})$ values is created by bootstrapping the data and recalculating the likelihood score on each tree (often this is done through the RELL procedure).
An example for the primate dataset is shown below (before centering on the left and centered on the right).
Note that the mean of this distribution, $\bar{\delta}(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)})$, taken over bootstrap replicates is very close to the observed value of the test statistic (around -3.2).\\
\begin{picture}(500,280)(0,-280)
	  \put(-30,-120){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../scripts/mtdna/uncentered1-2hist.pdf}}}
	  \put(70,-260){\normalsize${\delta}(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)})$}
	  \put(230,-120){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../scripts/mtdna/centered1-2hist.pdf}}}
	  \put(280,-260){\normalsize${\delta}(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)}) - \bar{\delta}(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)})$}
\end{picture}

Subtracting the mean of the bootstraps is a very simple procedure, but it is justified by the fact that expected value should be 0 under the null and the fact that the mean of a large sample should be close to the expected value.
We then treat the centered distribution as a simulation of draws from the null distribution.
We can calculate a \pvalue by counting the proportion of replicates from this simulated null yield values that deviate from the null at least as strongly as the observed test statistic (\pvalue$\approx$ 0.47 in this example).
In the figure below the tail region are shown in red.
Artifacts caused by binning values in the histogram make it appear that some of the values are less extreme than the observed value, but this is not the case.\\
\begin{picture}(500,280)(0,-280)
	  \put(100,-120){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../scripts/mtdna/centered1-2hist-p.pdf}}}
	  \put(100,-120){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../scripts/mtdna/centered1-2hist-tails.pdf}}}
	  \put(180,-260){\normalsize${\delta}(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)}) - \bar{\delta}(T_1,T_2|X^{(\ast)})$}
\end{picture}
You would have to do an enormous number of simulations if you wanted to estimate the \pvalue with great precision, but 10,000 RELL bootstraps do not take much computational effort.

    \put(-160,70){KH Test Cartoon shown in lecture}
  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
We can depict the KH Test in a cartoon of pattern frequency space as shown to the right.
The intent of the cartoon is to display the test statistic with lines connecting the
ML estimates of branch lengths in the tree to the point that corresponds to the pattern frequencies in the observed data (shown as a black dot). 
The length of the lines is negatively related to the $\lnL$, and the black portion is intended to convey the difference in the $\lnL$ between the trees; this is our $\delta$ test statistic.
In this cartoon, we can view the patterns as being ordered `chimp', `human', `orang+gibbon', and `gorilla'
Thus the tree with the highest likelihood, $T_2$, is colored in green and depicted with the 1100 pattern (chimp+human), and the other {\em a priori} tree, $T_1$, unites chimp and gorilla (pattern 1001).

The contour lines centered around the boundary between hypotheses are intended to convey the fact that we generate the null distribution by bootstrapping to create a population points in pattern frequency space (the contours can be thought of as a contours of the probability distribution, with the highest probability region being the central circle).
Recall that in the KH test, we calculate the $\delta$ test statistic for each bootstrapped replicate and then we center these values on 0; this centering is the reason that the contours in the KH test cartoon are centered on the boundary between $T_1$ and $T_2$.
In the actual test the $\delta$ test-statistics are ``centered'' to have a mean of 0, so perhaps the cartoon should look like the one below (note it is really the $\delta$ test statistics that are being centered, not the bootstrapped points in pattern frequency space).

	  \put(360,-282){\normalsize probability that a value as extreme }
	  \put(360,-294){\normalsize as $+$ would arise under the null. }
\end{picture}

Note that in these figures, only 2 trees are considered (the ``red'' tree is not shown); this is because the KH test requires that two tree be specified {\em a priori}.  
It is {\em not} appropriate to use this test to reject one {\em a priori} tree by comparing it to the ML tree.

Making similar plots for tree inference is hard.

Our parameter space is trees and branch lengths. Our data is a matrix of characters. It is hard to put these objects on the same plot.

We will see later (during ``cartoon time''), that we {\em can} visualize them both in a parameter space that describes how frequent different patterns of data are.

\section*{RELL bootstrap}
\large
If the MLE of the numerical parameters (including branch lengths) do not change much when we bootstrap we can simply resample the site $\ln L$ values and sum them.

This is called the RELL bootstrap \citep[][and Felsenstein]{KishinoMH1990}. It is not a ``safe'' replacement for normal bootstrapping \citep[especially on large trees;][]{StamatakisHR2008} when you want to estimate clade support.

But it should be good enough for helping us learn about the standard error of the $\ln L$.

And it is really fast.

$H_0$ gives us the expected value: $$\mathbb{E}_{H_0}\left[\delta(T_1,T_2|X)\right] = 0$$
Bootstrapping gives us a reasonable guess of the variance under $H_0$

By substracting the mean of the bootstrapped $\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast})$ values, we can create a null distribution.

For each of the $j$ bootstrap replicates, we treat $$\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast j}) - \bar\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast})$$  as draws from the null distribution.

The KH Test is {\bf NOT} appropriate in this context \citep[see][for discussion of this point]{GoldmanAR2000}
	
{\bf Multiple Comparisons}: lots of trees increases the variance of $\delta(\hat{T},T_1|X)$\\

{\bf Selection bias}: Picking the ML tree to serve as one of the hypotheses invalidates the centering procedure of the KH test.

\section*{Using the ML tree in your test introduces selection bias}
Even when the $H_0$ is true, we do not expect $2\left[\ln L(\hat{T}) - \ln L(T_1)\right]= 0$

\section*{Shimodaira and Hasegawa proposed the SH test which deals the ``selection bias'' introduced by using the ML tree in your test}
You have to specify of a set of candidate trees - inclusion in this set {\bf must not} depend on the dataset to be analyzed.

The null hypothesis is that all members of the candidate set have the same expected score.

{\bf SH Test details}
\normalsize
\begin{compactitem}
	\item For each tree $T_i$ in the candidate set calculate $\delta(\hat{T}, T_i|X)$
	\item Bootstrap to generate ${\ln L}(T_i|X^{(j)})$
	\item For each tree $T_i$, use $\bar{\ln L}(T_i|X^{\ast})$ to center the bootstrapped collection of log-likelihoods:
		$$c_i^{(j)} = {\ln L}(T_i|X^{(j)})-\bar{\ln L}(T_i|X^{\ast})$$
	\item For each replicate pick the highest value from the centered distributions (this mimics the selection bias): $$m^{(j)} = \max\left[c_i^{(j)}\right] \mbox{ over all } j$$
	\item The for each tree and replicate, you get a sample from the null $\delta_i^{(j)} = m^{(j)} - c_i^{(j)}$
	\item $P$-value for tree $T_i$ can be approximated by seeing where in the distribution of $\delta_i^{(j)}$ values it lies (the $P$-value is the proportion of sampled $\delta_i^{(j)} \geq \delta_i$

\section*{SH test candidate set selection}
\large
\begin{compactitem}
	\item The candidate set should be all trees that you would have seriously entertained before seeing the data. 
	\item Using all trees is safe (though weakens the test, and is computationally demanding).
	\item Unfortunately, only considering a subset of trees for computational convenience can invalidate the test.
	\item If a tree has low $\ln L$ and low variance of site-log-likelihoods then it can probably be safely removed without affecting the $P$-values of other trees\footnote{Because such a tree would be unlikely to ever be the tree that is the determines the maximum diplacement from the centered value, $m^{(j)}$.}

The test makes worst-case assumptions, so the SH test {\bf is too conservative}.

Generate the null distribution of $\delta_i$ by:

	\item Simulating a large number $B$ of data sets, $X^{(1)}, X^{(2)},\ldots,X^{(B)}$ according to the parameters of that model,
	\item Calculating $\delta^{(j)} = 2\left[\ln L (\hat{T}| X^{(j)}) - \ln L (\hat{T}_{0}| X^{(j)})\right]$ where $\hat{T}_{0}$ is the tree estimated when you enforce a constraint such that all of the trees are compatible with the null.

We can use a Bayesian model to show that $\tilde{\alpha}$ is a reasonable 
assessment of the probability that $\mathscr{R}_1$ contains $ \mu$.
Suppose we believe \textit{a priori} that $\mu$ could lie anywhere in the plane with 
equal probability. 
Then having observed $\hat{\mu}$, the \textit{a posteriori} 
distribution of  $\mu$ given  $\hat{\mu}$ is $N_2( \hat{\mu},I)$ exactly the same as the 
bootstrap distribution of $\hat{\mu}^{\ast}$. 
In other words, $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the  \textit{a posteriori}
probability of the event $\mu \in \mathscr{R}_1$, if we begin with an ``uninformative'' prior density for $\mu$.
