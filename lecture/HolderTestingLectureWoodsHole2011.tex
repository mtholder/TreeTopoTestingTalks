\section*{Reasons phylogenetic inference might be wrong}
\Large
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Our data might be wrong (``garbage in garbage out'')
	\item {\em Systematic error} -- Our inference method might not be sophisticated enough
	\item \underline{{\em Random error}} -- We might not have enough data, so we are misled by sampling error.
\end{compactenum}

(or it could be some combination of these).

{Focus of this evening: {\bf How confident can we be in the trees/splits inferred by ML?}}

\myNewSlide
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Bootstrapping to assess repeatability;
	\item Putting $P$-values on trees:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item KH Test, SH Test
		\item parametric bootstrapping,
	\end{compactitem}
	\item Brief lab on parametric bootstrapping.

\section*{Bootstrapping for branch support}
\large
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Rogue'' taxa can lower support for many splits -- you do not have to use the majority-rule consensus tree to summarize bootstrap confidence statements.
	\item Less thorough searching is faster, but will usually artificially lower bootstrap proportions (BP). However, \citet{AnisimovaGDDG2011} report that RAxML's rapid bootstrap algorithm may inflate BP.

\section*{Frequentist hypothesis testing: coin flipping example}
$N=100$ and $h=60$\\
Can we reject the hypothesis of a fair coin ($p_H = 0.5$)?

The ``recipe'' is:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Formulate null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_A$) hypotheses.
	\item Choose an acceptable Type-I error rate.
	\item Choose a test statistic: $f_H$= fraction of heads in sample. $f_H=0.6$
	\item Identify the tail region of the test statistic - the values that conflict with $H_0$ at least a strongly as your observed data.
	\item Calculate the $P$-value: The probability of a test statistic value more extreme than $0.6$ arising {\em even if $H_0$  is true}.
	\item Reject $H_0$ if $P$-value is $\leq$ your Type I error rate.

Making similar plots for tree inference is hard.

Our parameter space is trees and branch lengths. Our data is a matrix of characters. It is hard to put these objects on the same plot.

We will see later (during ``cartoon time''), that we {\em can} visualize them both in a parameter space that describes how frequent different patterns of data are.

Null: If we had no sampling error (infinite data) $T_1$ and $T_2$ would explain the data equally well.

\section*{KH Test - the variance of $\delta(T_1,T_2|X)$}
To get a sense of the variance of $\delta(T_1,T_2|X)$ we should expect because of sampling error, we could use:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Assumptions of Normality (by appealing to the Central Limit Theorem), or
	\item Bootstrapping to generate a cloud of pseudo-replicate $\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast})$ values.
\end{compactenum}

\myNewSlide
\section*{RELL bootstrap}
\large
If the MLE of the numerical parameters (including branch lengths) do not change much when we bootstrap we can simply resample the site $\ln L$ values and sum them.

This is called the RELL bootstrap \citep[][and Felsenstein]{KishinoMH1990}. It is not a ``safe'' replacement for normal bootstrapping \citep[especially on large trees;][]{StamatakisHR2008} when you want to estimate clade support.

But it should be good enough for helping us learn about the standard error of the $\ln L$.

And it is really fast.

\section*{KH Test - `centering'}
$H_0$ gives us the expected value: $$\mathbb{E}_{H_0}\left[\delta(T_1,T_2|X)\right] = 0$$
Bootstrapping gives us a reasonable guess of the variance under $H_0$

By substracting the mean of the bootstrapped $\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast})$ values, we can create a null distribution.

For each of the $j$ bootstrap replicates, we treat $$\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast j}) - \bar\delta(T_1,T_2|X^{\ast})$$  as draws from the null distribution.

\section*{What if start out with only one hypothesized tree, and we want to compare it to the ML tree?}
The KH Test is {\bf NOT} appropriate in this context \citep[see][for discussion of this point]{GoldmanAR2000}
	
{\bf Multiple Comparisons}: lots of trees increases the variance of $\delta(\hat{T},T_1|X)$\\

{\bf Selection bias}: Picking the ML tree to serve as one of the hypotheses invalidates the centering procedure of the KH test.

\myNewSlide
\section*{Using the ML tree in your test introduces selection bias}
Even when the $H_0$ is true, we do not expect $2\left[\ln L(\hat{T}) - \ln L(T_1)\right]= 0$

\section*{Shimodaira and Hasegawa proposed the SH test which deals the ``selection bias'' introduced by using the ML tree in your test}
You have to specify of a set of candidate trees - inclusion in this set {\bf must not} depend on the dataset to be analyzed.

The null hypothesis is that all members of the candidate set have the same expected score.

\myNewSlide
{\bf SH Test details}
\normalsize
\begin{compactitem}
	\item For each tree $T_i$ in the candidate set calculate $\delta(\hat{T}, T_i|X)$
	\item Bootstrap to generate ${\ln L}(T_i|X^{(j)})$
	\item For each tree $T_i$, use $\bar{\ln L}(T_i|X^{\ast})$ to center the bootstrapped collection of log-likelihoods:
		$$c_i^{(j)} = {\ln L}(T_i|X^{(j)})-\bar{\ln L}(T_i|X^{\ast})$$
	\item For each replicate pick the highest value from the centered distributions (this mimics the selection bias): $$m^{(j)} = \max\left[c_i^{(j)}\right] \mbox{ over all } j$$
	\item The for each tree and replicate, you get a sample from the null $\delta_i^{(j)} = m^{(j)} - c_i^{(j)}$
	\item $P$-value for tree $T_i$ can be approximated by seeing where in the distribution of $\delta_i^{(j)}$ values it lies (the $P$-value is the proportion of sampled $\delta_i^{(j)} \geq \delta_i$
\end{compactitem}

\myNewSlide
\section*{SH test candidate set selection}
\large
\begin{compactitem}
	\item The candidate set should be all trees that you would have seriously entertained before seeing the data. 
	\item Using all trees is safe (though weakens the test, and is computationally demanding).
	\item Unfortunately, only considering a subset of trees for computational convenience can invalidate the test.
	\item If a tree has low $\ln L$ and low variance of site-log-likelihoods then it can probably be safely removed without affecting the $P$-values of other trees\footnote{Because such a tree would be unlikely to ever be the tree that is the determines the maximum diplacement from the centered value, $m^{(j)}$.}
\end{compactitem}
The test makes worst-case assumptions, so the SH test {\bf is too conservative}.

	\item Calculating $\delta^{(j)} = 2\left[\ln L (\hat{T}| X^{(j)}) - \ln L (\hat{T}_{0}| X^{(j)})\right]$ where $\hat{T}_{0}$ is the tree estimated when you enforce a constraint such that all of the trees are compatible with the null.

Bootstrap proportions have been characterized as providing:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item a measure of repeatability,
	\item an estimate of the probability that the tree is correct (and bootstrapping has been criticized as being too conservative in this context),
	\item the P-value for a tree or clade

\section*{What did \citet{EfronHH1996} say?}
\normalsize
We can use a Bayesian model to show that $\tilde{\alpha}$ is a reasonable 
assessment of the probability that $\mathscr{R}_1$ contains $ \mu$.
Suppose we believe \textit{a priori} that $\mu$ could lie anywhere in the plane with 
equal probability. 
Then having observed $\hat{\mu}$, the \textit{a posteriori} 
distribution of  $\mu$ given  $\hat{\mu}$ is $N_2( \hat{\mu},I)$ exactly the same as the 
bootstrap distribution of $\hat{\mu}^{\ast}$. 
In other words, $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the  \textit{a posteriori}
probability of the event $\mu \in \mathscr{R}_1$, if we begin with an ``uninformative'' prior density for $\mu$.

Bootstrap proportions have been characterized as providing:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item {\color{grey} a measure of repeatability,}
	\item  {\color{grey} an estimate of the probability that the tree is correct (and criticized as being too conservative in this context),}
	\item the P-value for a tree or clade

\section*{coin flipping (yet again)}
$N=100$ and $H=60$

Can we reject the hypothesis of a fair coin?

We can use simulation to generate the null distribution (we could actually use the binomial distribution to analytically solve this one)...

If we bootstrap we get a sense of the variability in our estimate, but we can also get a tail probability for $\Pr(p^{(boot)} \leq 0.5)$

\section*{\cite{Susko2010} adjusted BP -- aBP}
Susko reports that the curvature arguments of \citet{EfronHH1996} and \citet{Shimodaira2002}, while not incorrect, ignore the {\bf sharp point} in parameter space around the polytomy.

He uses the curvature of the likelihood function to correct bootstrap proportions so that $1-aBP$ accurately estimates the $P$-value.

You need to perform a different correction when you know the candidate tree {\em a priori} versus when you are putting BP on the ML tree.

BP may {\bf not} be conservative when you correct for selection bias.

\section*{Summary - Part 1}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\delta(T_1,T_2|X) = 2\left[\ln L(T_1|X) - \ln L(T_2|X)\right]$ is a powerful statistic for discrimination between trees.
	\item We can assess confidence by considering the variance in signal between different characters.
	\item Bootstrapping helps us assess the variance in $\ln L$ that we would expect to result from sampling error.
\end{itemize}

A (very) wide variety of tests differ by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Null hypotheses:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Expected scores are the same $\rightarrow$ boundary tests. {\bf Non-parametric tests}
		\item A tree consistent with the null is correct $\rightarrow$ tests that use the full info of the model. {\bf Parametric tests}
	\end{compactitem}
	\item How to use variance information:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Rely on ``raw'' bootstrap variability,
		\item Invoke assumptions of normality of scores,
		\item Use $\chi^2$ variants.
	\end{compactitem}
	\item Whether or not the trees must be specified {\em a priori} -- KH Test requires the trees to be specified {\em a priori}.

When you use a parametric test, you will usually gain power. But non-parametric tests are more robust to model violation.
