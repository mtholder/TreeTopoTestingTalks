\section*{Significantly different genealogy $\neq$ different phylogeny}
\begin{itemize}
    \item True ``gene tree'' can differ from true ``species tree'' for several biological reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item deep coalescence,
        \item gene duplication/loss (you may be comparing paralogs),
        \item lateral gene transfer.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{We often don't want to test tree topologies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If we are conducting a ``comparative method'' we have to consider phylogenetic history,
    \item ideally we would integrate out the uncertainty in the phylogeny
\end{itemize}
