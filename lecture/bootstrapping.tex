\section*{Bootstrapping for branch support}
\large
\begin{itemize}
    \item Typically a few hundred bootstrap, pseudoreplicate datasets are produced.
    \item Less thorough searching is faster, but will usually artificially lower bootstrap proportions (BP). However, \citet{AnisimovaGDDG2011} report that RAxML's rapid bootstrap algorithm may inflate BP.
    \item ``Rogue'' taxa can lower support for many splits -- you do not have to use the majority-rule consensus tree to summarize bootstrap confidence statements.
\end{itemize}





\myNewSlide
\Large
Bootstrap proportions have been characterized as providing:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item a measure of repeatability,
    \item an estimate of the probability that the tree is correct (and bootstrapping has been criticized as being too conservative in this context),
    \item the P-value for a tree or clade
\end{compactitem}

\section*{coin flipping}
$N=100$ and $H=60$

Can we reject the hypothesis of a fair coin?

We can use simulation to generate the null distribution (we could actually use the binomial distribution to analytically solve this one)...

We discussed how bootstrapping gives us a sense of the variability ofour estimate

It can also give a tail probability for $\Pr(f_H^{(boot)} \leq 0.5)$

Amazingly (for many applications):
$$ \Pr(\hat{f}_H \geq 0.6 \mid \mbox{null is true}) \approx \Pr(f_H^{(boot)} \leq 0.5)$$

In other words, the $P$-value is approximate by the fraction of bootstrap replicates consistent with the null.

    \item When you decide between trees, the boundaries between tree hypotheses can be curved 
    \item When the boundary of the hypothesis space is curved, 1 - BP can be a poor approximation of the $P$-value. -- \citet{EfronHH1996}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple scales of bootstrap resampling (80\% of characters, 90\%, 100\%, 110\%$\ldots$) are used to detect and correct for curvature of the boundary.

\section*{\cite{Susko2010} adjusted BP -- aBP}
\large
\begin{compactitem}
    \item Susko agrees with curvature arguments of \citet{EfronHH1996} and \citet{Shimodaira2002}, {\bf but} points out that they ignore the {\bf sharp point} in parameter space around the polytomy.

    \item He correct bootstrap proportions:  $1-aBP$ accurately estimates the $P$-value.

    \item The method uses the multivariate normal distributions the based on calculations about the curvature of the {\em likelihood} surface.

    \item You need to perform a different correction when you know the candidate tree {\em a priori} versus when you are putting BP on the ML tree.

    \item BP may {\bf not} be conservative when you correct for selection bias.

\section*{Conclusions -- bootstrapping}\large
\large
\begin{compactenum}
    \item Non-parametric bootstrapping proportions help us see which branches
    have so little support that they could be plausibly explained by sampling error.
    \item BPs are a little hard to interpret  precisely.
    \item Susko has and adjustment (``aBP``) so that $1 - aBP\approx P$-value for the hypothesis that a recovered branch is not present in the true tree. 
\end{compactitem}
