This repository contains images, scripts, bibliographic data (.bib format)
and LaTeX code for slides related to statistical tests of topologies.

Figures are either:
    - taken from papers (the name of the file will indicate the citation),
    - borrowed from Joe Felsenstein and tweaked (the files "JoeFels..."),
    - or created by Mark Holder 


Directories
===========
    * 'lecture' : source code for slides
    * 'newimages' :  image files (an unfortunate name required to 
            avoid name clashes on Mark's machine)
    * 'review' : notes on the literature and references
    * 'scripts' : python and r scripts for generating figures and simulations
            also contains example data files.
    * 'wiki' : wiki syntax used to write lab exercises (currently in MediaWiki 
            format only)
